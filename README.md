- **chatbot.py**: Python script for running the chatbot.
- **intents.json**: JSON file containing predefined intents and responses for the chatbot.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Requests (for weather API)

   ```
3. Download NLTK data:
   ```
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt
   python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the training script to train the chatbot model:
   ```
